"Please explain any limitations when using materialized views (e.g., limits on masking).","Databricks’s implementation of Materialized Views are unique in that they offer the full expressivity of the SQL language. 

Materialized views must be deterministic. For example, using CURRENT_TIMESTAMP is not permitted Materialized views cannot be created using the Delta Lake time travel feature [1]

https://docs.databricks.com/sql/user/materialized-views.html#limitations"
"Does Databricks have document store capabilities (e.g., JSON, XML)? Is this supported as a native object, as a variant or translated to a relational form?","Yes, currently supported. It is supported as a native object and as a variant."
"Please describe the level of support for advanced document store features (e.g., indexing) including any limitations. Note if there are any special, efficient data storage formats used.","Databricks has the most extensive format support of any data warehousing platform. Databricks supports JSON as a native object and can similarly read/write XML and pretty much any other exotic format that customers might be using (e.g. RC and Protobuf) [1]. Databricks uses intelligent indexing based on access patterns and makes it extremely fast to retrieve parts of the JSON object. Further, with Databricks support for the Variant data type for storing semi-structured data. Processing JSON data as a variant is both fast and flexible (variant does not require a specific schema). With Variant, json data is stored in an efficient binary representation [2], which allows for ultra-fast look-ups. Variant query performance when compared to storing json as a string is 8x to 20x faster [3].
Databricks supports a number of connectors to document storage systems, like MongoDB, Azure Cosmos, and Couchbase. Databricks can read and write JSON and XML files from various storage systems, such as Azure Blob Storage, Azure Data Lake Storage, Amazon S3, and DBFS (Databricks File System). Databricks can also use Spark SQL to query JSON and XML data using SQL or DataFrame APIs. Additionally, Databricks can connect to external document store databases, such as MongoDB and Couchbase, using JDBC/ODBC drivers or Spark connectors [4].

How is data sharing implemented?,"Delta Sharing is an open source, platform-agnostic, and cross-cloud secure data sharing protocol. Delta Sharing enables secure sharing of structured data, unstructured volumes, notebooks, and AI models across clouds, regions, & platforms. Delta Sharing enables both Databricks-to-Databricks sharing, as well as Databricks-to-Open sharing, enabling customers to reach all of their partners regardless of whether they use Databricks or not. Databricks offers a managed Delta Sharing offering integrated with Unity Catalog, offering customers unified governance across internal data and shared data. Delta Sharing has an active ecosystem of organizations (e.g. Oracle) who implement the open source server independently of Databricks. With Delta Sharing, the data assets are shared ‘live’ with the recipient, eliminating the need for multiple copies. Recipients receive direct access to the provider’s underlying cloud storage, allowing for parallel, scalable, and secure access. This approach provides cost and performance advantages, with storage and transfer costs matching the underlying cloud object store. Providers can further optimize their costs by choosing storage platforms such as Cloudflare R2, which offers $0 egress cost for cross-cloud/region sharing. Using open connectors, data recipients can consume their shares in a number of tools, including Power BI, Tableau, Apache Spark, or Pandas, regardless of whether they use Databricks or not. Data providers use Delta Sharing in Databricks to share a wide range of Unity Catalog assets, including sharing structured data (e.g. Views) and AI assets (e.g. models, volumes). Expanding on this, we have announced that Delta Sharing will also offer the ability for customers to share data hosted in external data warehouses or databases (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), without the need to move the data into Databricks (aka Lakehouse Federation sharing) https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-sharing/index.html"
Does Databricks provide faceted search capability for semistructured or joined data?,"Yes, Mosaic AI Vector Search is a vector database that is built into the Databricks Data Intelligence Platform and fully integrated with its governance and productivity tools. With this functionality, customers can easily create a vector search index from any Delta table within the Databricks platform [1]. The index includes embedded data with metadata. Users can then query the index using the REST API to identify the most similar vectors and return the associated documents. The index is also addressable via Python or via SQL functions, making it possible to implement a RAG application with just SQL [2]. Customers can configure the index to automatically sync to changes to the underlying Delta table, allowing for transactional updates (given that Delta table updates are transactional in nature). Faceted search is supported through the filters API in the search interface [3]
Vector Search supports encrypting customer data with customer managed encryption keys. [1]

How does Databricks offer parallelization for operations?,"Databricks supports parallelism for most operations including (a) Data parallelism (writing and reading), (b) Task parallelism, (c) Workload or Job parallelism. For each of these Databricks uses Serverless compute [1] and powerful AI algorithms to automatically set the right degree of parallelism to achieve the highest price/performance for a given workload (up to 12x better [8]), while also reducing the operational burden on customers to constantly tune parameters to achieve desired results. For customers who need customization or control, parameters are still available.
Task parallelism: Users can control the total number of cores/task-slots available for a given workload by configuring the size of the cluster, and this can be changed/resized dynamically while the workload is executing [2]. The default parallelism can be controlled on a per-query basis by changing the default number of shuffle partitions [3] Control the parallelism for a specific stage of a single query by using the repartition function in the DataFrame API[4] or SQL[5]. The system also dynamically adjusts the parallelism for a given stage based on the size of the actual data being processed using Adaptive Query Execution[6].
Autoscaling is available to change the number of available clusters depending on workload and overal number of workloads [7]

Can parallelism be set regardless of data partitions or is parallel execution achieved by having workloads run against each partition?,"Yes, set regardless of partitions. Parallelism can be achieved without partitions. Multiple workloads can run against the same unpartitioned tables. Data and metadata are in the object storage layer, so there is no limit on number of parallel threads consuming that table [1]. Similarly for write workloads multiple parallel threads could be writing to the same table as long as there are no logical concurrency conflicts ie two parallel threads trying to update the same file at the same time. For such special workloads, customers use partitions to write to those tables concurrently to avoid concurrency conflicts [2]. [1]https://docs.delta.io/0.4.0/delta-concurrency.html
[2]https://docs.databricks.com/optimization"
"Does Databricks support an in-memory column store for analytic workloads? Is the in-memory column store updateable? If so, explain the granularity (e.g., minibatch, continuous).","Databricks supports in-memory column storage for tables[1] for both analytic and machine learning workloads. Databricks’ Spark engine also internally uses columnar in-memory data to enable SIMD optimizations like data striping for better cache and other performance advantages. NVMe SSD[2] can also be used.
Databricks partitions the in-memory store across multiple nodes in the cluster [3] including range, hash, and round-robin to deal with data skew. This results in the in-memory store being massively parallel and scaling transparently across the nodes in a compute cluster. It is not unusual for customers to run clusters with over 1000 nodes querying 5PB+ tables.
The in-memory columnar store is updateable at a mini-batch level. If the customer is using an NVMe SSD based column store, it can be updated continuously at per row level[4].

"Does Databricks keep history and show historical query performance, trends, etc.?","Yes, Databricks does keep query history and show historical performance, trends etc. for SQL queries performed using SQL warehouses. You can use the query history to view the details of a query execution, such as the duration, SQL command, number of rows returned, and I/O performance. Databricks also has system tables that has Audit logs, Billable usage logs, Table and column lineage. By default the history is retained for 90 days."
Which languages are supported?,"SQL, Java, Javascript, Python, Scala, Go, R. UDFs can be written in SQL, Scala, Java or Python. When possible, UDF execution is vectorized using Apache Arrow to maximize throughput (up to 100x vs. conventional scalar UDFs) - this is common for UDFs developed using pandas, a popular data analysis and manipulation library [1]. 
[1] https://docs.databricks.com/udf/pandas.html#pandas-user-defined-functions"
What kind of alerts can you set in Databricks?,"Databricks supports alerts based on arbitrary SQL conditions [2], as well as alerts and notifications emitted when workloads are completed, failed, are being retried, or are delayed [1]. Native notification tool integrations include Slack, PagerDuty, Microsoft Teams and HTTP webhooks.
Users have detailed control over when an alert is triggered, e.g. common cases like automated retries of workloads can be excluded from triggering an alert.

Can you view and query tables at a previous point in time?,"Yes, this feature is called Delta Time Travel and it allows users to access any historical version of the big data stored in their data lake, which simplifies data pipeline, audit, rollback, and reproducibility [1]. Users can also overwrite, append, or merge data to a table with implicit schema change accommodation.
To use Delta Time Travel, users can specify either a timestamp or a version number when reading a Delta table or directory[2] . For example, in Scala:
val df = spark.read
.format(""delta"")
.option (""timestampAsOf"", ""2019-01-01"")
.load (""/path/to/my/table"")
This will load the version of the table as of 2019-01-01. Alternatively, users can use version numbers:
val df = spark.read
.format(""delta"")
.option (""versionAsOf"", 10)
.load (""/path/to/my/table"")
This will load the version of the table with version number 10.
Both version numbers and timestamps are supported in SQL and Python[2]. An example of SQL syntax based on version number is:
SELECT count(*)
FROM mytable
VERSION AS OF 10
This will return the count of rows in the table with version number 10.
Delta Time Travel is a powerful feature that enables users to work with changing data in a reliable and efficient way. It also provides a foundation for building advanced analytics applications that require temporal data management.

"Can change management be performed to database schema across multiple instances of the same database? Please explain, including the level of automation.","Schema change management can be performed across database instances. Databricks natively supports the standard change management systems that already exist in most companies: CI/CD; by integrating with Git providers. The Repos feature[1] provides repository-level integration with Azure DevOps, GitHub, GitLab, and all other git-compliant versioning systems. The API[2] provides a surface to integrate Databricks with CI/CD systems like Jenkins. This is the industry standard way of moving changes including database schema changes from development environments to Staging and production environments.
The Databricks Stack CLI allows users to declaratively specify all of the resources for a user's analytics pipelines and check them into standard version control systems such as git. These can be deployed to one or more workspaces. In addition this can be used in a production CI/CD environment[3].
Databricks supports schema evolution. The schema of a table can be automatically updated when columns are added or modified[4]. Schema evolution can be fully automatic, allowing Delta Lake to automatically evolve the table schema based on incoming data. It can be triggered at the time of data ingestion [5] or during DML operations like MERGE [6]. [1] https://docs.databricks.com/repos.html

Is it possible to forecast consumption and costs?,"Yes - It is possible to forecast resource consumption.
For costumes leverage fixed-cost pricing models this is of course trivial / known.
For customers using consumption pricing, Databricks provides resource consumption statistics and tools to model that consumption into the future. Admins can use pre-created notebooks [1] or build custom forecasts that include additional business context in order to predict capacity and budget needs.
With AI/BI Genie[2], these questions can be asked in plain English and answered by pulling in relevant context from the Data Intelligence Platform.
With the system.compute.warehouse_events and system.compute.warehouses system tables [3] users can monitor DBMS capacity over time, including vertical and horizontal compute scaling (clusters and t-shirt sizes). These system tables enable admins to create warehouse monitors for warehouses that have been running longer than expected, upscaled longer than expected, or dramatically upscaled.

How does Databricks assist customers with capacity planning?,"Databricks is encouraging customers to move to our fully serverless offerings, where Databricks manages overall capacity across customers / clouds / regions to ensure there is sufficient capacity available for customers. When customers leverage serveless, they don’t have to manage capacity in the same way they would with traditional DBMS systems. We offer deep cost analytics, alerting and controls so customers can monitor and manage spend.
For non-serverless capacity, customers can choose pre-built capacities (e.g. S, M, L, XL) [1] and they can assign these capacities to specific users, groups and projects. Databricks also enables customers to leverage their reserved instances for compute, as well as spot pricing [2] for workloads, so that customers can make the most of the capacity they are already managing or only run workloads when cheap capacity is available.
System tables offer fine-grained analytics on all capacity. With the system.compute.warehouse_events, system.compute.warehouses system tables users can monitor DBMS capacity over time, including vertical and horizontal compute scaling (clusters and t-shirt sizes). These system table enables admins to create warehouse monitors for warehouses that have been running longer than expected, upscaled longer than expected, or dramatically upscaled. Additionally, admins can use pre-created notebooks to build custom forecasts to predict capacity and budget needs. This has the advantage of going beyond just resource consumption and connecting to bottom line expenditures and budgeting conversations.

How does Databricks compute handle bursts in demand?,"Databricks can elastically grow compute via auto-scaling capabilities. Customers can specify machine types, spot bidding limits, spin up and spin down parameters, and as the workload adjusts, the number of nodes in clusters spin up and down to help control costs. Customers only pay for what they use. This leads to much lower TCO than comparable systems, where “fixed” resources are spun up or reserved based on the estimated demand size. For example, a customer with thousands of employees can utilize the same cluster, which autoscales from zero to thousands of nodes. As employee work peaks, nodes are rapidly added, and as nodes idle they are spun down. Additionally, they can be cached in a resource pool that is instantly available but are not incurring cost. There is no pause in processing when clusters resize. 

With our serverless offerings, customers simply set the maximum spend rate for their workload and we handle the provision / scaling from zero to thousands of nodes on their behalf."
"Does the Databricks allow control over geographic distribution of data to respect data sovereignty requirements, within an individual CSP’s regions or in an intercloud scenario?","Yes. Databricks allows control over geographic distribution of data to respect data sovereignty requirements. Databricks is available in 71 Regions around the world in AWS, Azure and GCP including support for Azure & AWS Government clouds with more restrictive residency requirements. It is configured to be regionally secure by default and designed to meet the strictest Data Residency requirements such as the ones mandated by GDPR and CCPA, and those mandated by specific countries, like China (PRC). A Databricks workspace is tied to a single cloud/region and all compute, storage, networking default to be contained within the same region. Data will never leave that region without user request, and storage/networking firewalls can be configured for another level of enforcement. The movement of data within regions/clouds must always be explicit (for example by configuring Delta Sharing), which means that Databricks will never move data unbeknownst to the customer, and customers can easily manage and audit cross-cloud/region access if allowed at all. For services that benefit from specialized resources with limited availability (e.g. high end GPUs for ML model training and LLM serving) Databricks has an additional concept called “Databricks Geos”, which are used only by designated services” that leverage compute in other datacenter regions (within a broader geography concept like “EU”) while still respecting data sovereignty rules (e.g. EU data boundaries). For GenAI, the highest quality GPUs allow us to deliver best in class price/performance for open source models. Our designated services currently include Databricks Assistant and services within the Mosaic AI platform. This setup allows customers to leverage the best resources available across clouds/geos for GenAI while still remaining confidently in control of data sovereignty requirements.

"What are Databricks jobs and job clusters, and why should someone use them?","Databricks Jobs allow users to run non-interactive code in an automated way, and Job Clusters are dedicated clusters created specifically for these jobs. Here's how they work:

Databricks Jobs:
Definition: A job is a way to execute a task, such as running a notebook, script, or JAR file, on a schedule or in response to an event.
Scheduling: Supports one-time or recurring schedules for batch processing.
Multi-Task Jobs: Allows creating jobs with multiple tasks, defining dependencies and execution order.
Monitoring: Provides interfaces to monitor job execution, view progress, and troubleshoot errors.
Job Clusters:
Purpose-Built Clusters: Created specifically to run a job and terminated upon completion.
Isolation: Ensures that each job runs in a clean environment without interference from other jobs.
Cost Efficiency: Reduces costs by spinning up clusters only when needed and tearing them down afterwards.
Configuration Management: Jobs specify the cluster configuration, ensuring consistency across runs.

Benefits:
Resource Optimization: Saves resources by using clusters only when necessary, which is cost-effective for batch workloads.
Enhanced Reliability: Isolated job clusters prevent issues in one job from affecting others.
Simplified Management: Eliminates the need to manually manage cluster lifecycles for scheduled jobs.
Scalability: Can handle an increasing number of jobs by efficiently managing compute resources.

By utilizing Jobs and Job Clusters, Databricks provides a robust solution for automating and scaling batch data processing tasks."
Can you explain how Databricks handles large-scale data ingestion and ETL processes?,"Databricks handles large-scale data ingestion and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) by leveraging its scalable architecture and features designed for efficient data processing:

Scalable Compute Resources: Utilizes Spark clusters that can scale horizontally to handle large volumes of data.
Delta Lake: Offers efficient storage and management of large datasets with ACID compliance, enabling safe concurrent reads and writes.
Auto Loader: Simplifies incremental data ingestion from cloud object stores, automatically detecting and processing new files efficiently.
Optimized Data Formats: Supports Parquet and ORC file formats, which are optimized for analytical queries and compression.
Parallel Processing: Distributes ETL workloads across multiple nodes in a cluster, allowing for faster data processing.
Data Partitioning and Skipping: Uses partitioning strategies and data skipping techniques to reduce the amount of data read during queries.
Pipeline Orchestration: Provides tools like Databricks Workflows to automate and manage ETL pipelines, including scheduling and dependency management.
Transformations with Spark SQL and DataFrames: Offers powerful APIs for data transformation using familiar SQL syntax or DataFrame operations.

These capabilities enable organizations to ingest and process terabytes to petabytes of data efficiently, turning raw data into actionable insights."
How does Databricks support real-time data streaming and what technologies does it integrate with?,"Databricks supports real-time data streaming through its integration with Apache Spark Structured Streaming and other technologies:

Structured Streaming: Provides a scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing engine built on Spark SQL, allowing users to write streaming queries in the same way as batch queries.
Integration with Message Queues:
Apache Kafka: Supports reading from and writing to Kafka topics, enabling real-time data ingestion and publication.
Amazon Kinesis and Azure Event Hubs: Integrates with cloud-based streaming services for seamless data ingestion from various sources.
Delta Lake Streaming: Allows streaming data to be ingested and stored in Delta Lake tables, benefiting from ACID transactions and schema enforcement.
Auto Loader: Simplifies streaming file ingestion from cloud storage systems by automatically detecting and processing new files as they arrive.
Window Operations: Supports complex event processing with windowed aggregations, joins, and other stateful operations.
Checkpoints and Recoverability: Maintains progress information to ensure that streaming applications can recover from failures without data loss.

By integrating these streaming technologies, Databricks enables users to build robust real-time data pipelines for use cases such as stream analytics, fraud detection, and real-time monitoring."
What is Databricks AutoML and how does it simplify the machine learning process?,"Databricks AutoML is a feature that automates the process of building machine learning models, making it accessible even to those with limited expertise in ML. It simplifies the machine learning workflow by:

Automated Model Generation: Automatically trains multiple models using a variety of algorithms and hyperparameter configurations.
Feature Engineering: Identifies and creates relevant features from raw data, handling missing values and categorical variables.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides detailed metrics and visualizations to compare model performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Generated Notebooks: Produces notebook code for each model, allowing users to review, customize, and reproduce the results.
Time Savings: Reduces the time required to develop models manually, accelerating the experimentation process.
Accessibility: Lowers the barrier to entry for machine learning by handling complex tasks under the hood.

By automating these steps, Databricks AutoML allows data scientists and analysts to focus on evaluating models and interpreting results rather than coding and tuning models from scratch."
